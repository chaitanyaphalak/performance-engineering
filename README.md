## Performance Engineering Reading List

A reading/viewing list about the theory and practice of performance engineering with
a focus on distributed web services and applications.

[Suggestions](CONTRIBUTING.md) are welcome.

Inspired by
[M. McGranaghan services engineering reading list](https://github.com/mmcgrana/services-engineering).
